# PokemonAnalytics
We built an interactive dashboard that lets users compare Pokémon stats like Attack, Defense, HP, and Speed side by side.  
This project also includes filtering by Pokémon type and generation, offering a fun and informative way to explore how Pokémon differ across games. 
The underlying data was preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency before visualization.
